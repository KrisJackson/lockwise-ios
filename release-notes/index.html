<p>This is a big update and we hope you enjoy it! Here's are the two major changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We've improved the search experience to use newer iOS features to help keep it stable and working consistently (which means we now require you use iOS 11).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We added iPad support so you can browse your logins in a full-screen app. On top of that, you can drag-and-drop your usernames and passwords into websites and apps if you use multitasking mode (Split View, Slide Over).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="140-build-2880">1.4.0 (Build 2880)</h2>
<p><em>Date: 2019-02-22</em></p>
<p>This is a big update and we hope you enjoy it! Here's are the two major changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We've improved the search experience to use newer iOS features to help keep it stable and working consistently (which means we now require you use iOS 11).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We added iPad support so you can browse your logins in a full-screen app. On top of that, you can drag-and-drop your usernames and passwords into websites and apps if you use multitasking mode (Split View, Slide Over).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Date: 2019-01-08</em></p>
<p>We've improved the search experience (and coming soon: added iPad support)! This is a big update and we hope you enjoy it. Here's the full list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the search experience to leverage built-in iOS features to help keep it stable and working consistently (which means we now require iOS 11)</li>

<h2 id="133-build-2731">1.3.3 (Build 2731)</h2>
<p><em>Date: 2018-12-19</em></p>
<p>We fixed more bugs and added some (hopefully) helpful icons to the item detail view. You should see some slight improvements but nothing major. Here's the full list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>We added icons to show that you can open the webpage and/or copy the username and password with one tap</li>
<li>We fully close the database so it can't crash in the background, this means you should see AutoFill work more reliably</li>
<li>If you don't have any saved logins in your Firefox Account and try to enable AutoFill, we gracefully stop trying to set that up for you (since there's nothing to set up yet!)</li>
<li>We also updated some underlying libraries to keep up with other fixes and improvements</li>
</ul>

<li>Additional steps are taken to not display multiple overlays at one time so it's clear what's been copied</li>

<p><em>Date: 2018-08-27</em></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: YOU MAY EXPERIENCE A CRASH!</strong> We're aware of an issue when you open the app it immediately crashes (and are working to gather more data and fix it). If this does happen, please re-open the app and continue testing everything else from there. Thank you!</p>
<p>It's been a month since our launch and we've been working hard to replace the old way of logging in with Firefox Accounts and fixing some bugs. For new users, they'll encounter a smoother and clearer experience. For existing users with the app already installed, you'll just need to sign in once again.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced the OAuth login flow to replace the "old" way of signing in</li>
<li>Added a "migration path" so users with the app sign back in and store data properly</li>
<li>The app clears your local storage and cache when you disconnect your account</li>
<li>You can now "pull to refresh" to force a sync when looking at an empty list</li>
<li>We fixed some alignment bugs for iPhone SEs running iOS 10</li>
<li>The autolock feature has been hardened as to when and how it locks the app</li>
<li>The app no longer dynamically adjusts the navigation bar sizes so it can be usable</li>
<li>If you type a very long search term you can "Cancel" and clear it as expected now</li>
<li>We improved the small arrows next to links</li>
<li>You can now "Ask a Question" from the settings screen to contact us directly</li>
</ul>
